# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Getting MEAN with... book tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Coudn't get 'heroku local web' to work. 

**Link to work:** [loc8r app](https://github.com/Operationbackfire/loc8r)

### Day 1: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Getting MEAN with... book tutorial.

**Thoughts:** heroku local still dosn't work. Made my first issue.

**Link to work:** [github 1. issue](https://github.com/Operationbackfire/loc8r/issues/1)

### Day 2: January 21, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got heroku to work. Did some Jade. When I tried to push to heroku end the end it failed again.

**Thoughts:** I used an answer from Stackoverflow to get heroku to work, but en the end the answer failed me. I coudn't be repeated.

**Link to work:** Nothing.

### Day 3: January 22, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Referencing data in Jade templates: interpolation and buffered code. Mixin in Jade. Trying out MongoDB. Installed with brew. Don't know if it is alive yet. Intalled Mongoose package for NodeJS. Added some lines of code to models/db.js, and referenced it from app.js.

**Thoughts:** Will get MongoDB to work tomorrow.

**Link to work:** Not much. Heroku is still failing me. Something wrong the the Dezalgo package.

### Day 4: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** MEANapp: mongodb is now working. There is a difference between 'mongod' and 'mongo'. Making the /data/db folder, changing permissions and adding to the $PATH. With some help from Stackoverflow and the mongodb installation homepage. New words: collection, document, schema and path.
Neso Academy and Digital Circuits: Watched youtube videos about latches,flip-flops and now counters. Not finished counters yet. 

**Thoughts:** Try to find the connection between Digital Circuit and the Gezel language.

**Link to work:** Nothing yet.

### Day 5: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made a profile on mLab and mongodumped a collection from my MEANapp.

**Thoughts:** Every day a small step. Got Heroku to work by deleting all npm directories and package-lock.json. I also used npm update. I don't what worked, but it worked.

**Link to work:** Nothing yet.

### Day 6: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Arduinoday. Break from the MEANapp.

**Thoughts:** How to use the 16 pin DIP? Is it a shift Register/many flip-flops in a row. Maybe this one https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftOut.

**Link to work:** https://cryptic-spire-24600.herokuapp.com/

### Day 7: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Did some python. Got stuck in at recursive definition of a function, that had to count the depth of a treestructure tuple. Break from the MEANapp.

**Thoughts:** Shift Register SISO, PISO and PIPO, and SIPO at Neso Academy.

**Link to work:** The same as yesterday.

### Day 8: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** New stuff in Python: dictionary {}, timeit library with the Timer function didn't, maybe because it was for Python 3. I did some recursion exercises, but got stuck in Pascals triangle.

**Thoughts:** When I haved solved some more recursion exercises I will go back to lib0 from the MIT AI course.

**Link to work:** Here are the link to the recursion exercises. https://www.python-course.eu/recursive_functions.php and https://www.python-course.eu/python3_recursive_functions.php

### Day 9: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** I tried to understand the solution to calculating the n'th row of the Pascal Triangle nad also the solution to calculating the Fibonacci Sequence from the Pascal Triangle. I made an iterative solution to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, but still have to understand the solution to the recursive solution. 

**Thoughts:** Having the same thought as yesterday __When I haved solved some more recursion exercises I will go back to lib0 from the MIT AI course.__ I have to figure how a Fixed Point Combinator works and what Beta-reduction is. It has something to do with recursive functions.

**Link to work:** Here are the link to the recursion exercises. https://www.python-course.eu/recursive_functions.php and https://www.python-course.eu/python3_recursive_functions.php

### Day 10: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished lab0 of AT MIT.

**Thoughts:** Went back and nailed it.

**Link to work:** No links today.

### Day 11: January 30, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Tried to do lab1 of AT MIT. Wrote some family relation rules and used them to construct new rules about the family. Data: simpsons and black (from Harry Potter). I didn't write the backchaining function, but tried to understand a solution. It was important to use the functions match, populate and the member functions .antecedent and .consequent of the class IF. It was difficult to understand when to shift between the classes AND and OR and the list class.

**Thoughts:** I moved on to lab2. Need to implement DFS,BFS,Hill Climbing and Beam on a graph structure tomorrow. 

**Link to work:** No links today.
