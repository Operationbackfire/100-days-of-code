### Day 3: January 22, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Referencing data in Jade templates: interpolation and buffered code. Mixin in Jade. Trying out MongoDB. Installed with brew. Don't know if it is alive yet. Intalled Mongoose package for NodeJS. Added some lines of code to models/db.js, and referenced it from app.js.

**Link to work:** Not much. Heroku is still failing me. Something wrong the the Dezalgo package.

### Day 4: January 23, 2018

With some help from Stackoverflow and the mongodb installation homepage. New words: collection, document, schema and path.
